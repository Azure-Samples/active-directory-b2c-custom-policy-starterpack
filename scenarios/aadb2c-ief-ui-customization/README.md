Adding Dynamic UI Customization to Azure AD B2C Custom policy workflows.
With custom policy, you can also customize the look and feel for your user, dynamically. B2C custom policy allows you to send through a parameter in a query string. That parameter  passes on to your HTML endpoint and can dynamically change the page content. For example, you can change the B2C sign-up or sign in background image, based on a parameter you pass from your web/mobile application.
