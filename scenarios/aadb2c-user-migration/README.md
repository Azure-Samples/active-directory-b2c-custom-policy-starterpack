# Azure AD B2C User migration
When you plan to migrate your identity provider to Azure AD B2C, you may also need to migrate the users account as well. 
This code sample and Azure AD B2C policy demonstrate how to migrate existing user accounts, from any identity provider to Azure AD B2C. This code sample is not meant to be prescriptive, but rather describes two of several different approaches. The developer is responsible for suitability and performances.
